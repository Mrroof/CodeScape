cybersecurity roles, processes and OS security


I look for technical skills, including operating system knowledge, such as Linux, Mac OS, 
Windows, database knowledge, cross-site scripting, malware, DDoS, and cybersecurity knowledge 
in general, especially around firewalls and antivirus.
We can define IT security as the practice of defending computer servers, mobile devices, 
electronic systems, networks, its data from malicious attacks. This term can also be known as 
information security or cybersecurity on field.
 We're going to talk about frameworks, we're going to talk about best practices, and here are just 
a good differentiation between best practices, baseline frameworks, normative and compliance
We'll have, for example, best practices, we will have a baseline, or we will have framework.
 A good example of framework is copied, or good example of best practices in some cases spraying 
worried bent up your business is ITIL.
